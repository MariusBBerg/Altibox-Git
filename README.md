# Altibox-Switch
Altibox is a tv-provider, when you subscribe to them you get points which you can use to get access to different channels. This program easily switch betweens the main channels without you having to log in to the website. This is just a beginner project, and is my second application I have ever made.

In this program, you can either use the setupfile and download the application, or you can just run the frontend.py file.

You have to edit the config.json file and add your Altibox username and password on that. You also have to download the Chromium, if you launch the application for the first time.
